MARISA: Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge

- Version

0.2.0

- Description

*Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge (MARISA)* is a static and space-efficient trie data structure. And *libmarisa* is a C++ library to provide an implementation of MARISA. Also, the package of *libmarisa* contains a set of command line tools for building and operating a MARISA-based dictionary.

A MARISA-based dictionary supports not only lookup but also reverse lookup, common prefix search and predictive search.

 * Lookup is to check whether or not a given string exists in a dictionary.
 * Reverse lookup is to restore a key from its ID.
 * Common prefix search is to find keys from prefixes of a given string.
 * Predictive search is to find keys starting with a given string.

The biggest advantage of *libmarisa* is that its dictioanry size is considerably more compact than others. See below for the dictionary size of other implementations.
