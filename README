Project summary:
  Nesting Patricia -> Matryoshka Patricia -> Matricia -> Marisa.

Description:
  *marisa-trie* provides a C++ library and command line tools for building and
  operating a nesting patricia, which is designed as a static and space
  efficient dictionary structure. A nesting patricia provides not only simple
  lookups but also prefix searches and predictive searches, as well as an
  original trie does.

   * Prefix searches are to find keys from prefixes of a given query.
   * Predictive searches are to find keys starting with a given query.

  One of the advantages of marisa-trie is in its space efficiency. See below
  for the size of dictionaries built with various trie implementations.

   * Input
    * Source: enwiki-20100622-all-titles-in-ns0
    * Number of keys: 7,967,237
    * Total size: 160,340,531 bytes

  || *Implementation* || *Size (bytes)* || *Remarks*                   ||
  || darts-clone      ||    303,413.248 || Compacted double-array trie ||
  || tx-trie          ||    102,802,911 || LOUDS-based trie            ||
  || marisa-trie      ||     41,304,636 || Nesting patricia trie       ||

  *marisa-trie* can build a remarkably compact dictionary compared with other
  implementations. In this case, the dictionary size is only 1/4 of the input
  size.
